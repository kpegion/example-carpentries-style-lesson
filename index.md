In atmosphere, ocean, and climate science most of our work is done on Unix or Linux computers.  The AOES/COLA computers that you will use
as a student are Linux computers.  To do your research on these computers you need to know how to interact with the file system, including 
finding and access files for the datasets you will work with.  These lessons will start you on the path for how to do this.

> ## Prerequisites
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
>
> If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
> searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
> and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson: [shell-extras](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/).
